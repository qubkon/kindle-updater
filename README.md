# Kindle Updater

>Script in Python to check if new software version is available for Kindle Paperwhite 4 (or any other model after you change `model_page_url` in code). Just a simple proof of concept project.

A bit of context why I made it: Kindle doesn't offer an option to check for updates straight from the device so either: 
1. Amazon releases new version and Kindle will automatically download it when connected to network,
2. ^ sometimes it doesn't work, so you may want to download _.bin_ file manually from the website, copy to device and then install it.

Option 2) means every now and then you have to check [Amazon's website](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKMQC26VQQMM8XSW). That gave me an idea to write a script which will automate that. 

Program crawls and scrapes the website, extracts current software version using [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), compares with already installed on my device and if it's newer, then automatically downloads the _.bin_ file. No need to visit a single page ðŸ¤“
